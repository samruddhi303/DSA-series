Data structure = Data structure is way to arrange data in memory efficiently.
Algorithms= sequence of steps to perform operations on data 
DSA (Data Structures and Algorithms) is the study of organizing data efficiently using data structures like arrays, stacks, and trees, paired with step-by-step procedures (or algorithms) to solve problems effectively.
Data structures manage how data is stored and accessed, while algorithms focus on processing this data.
features =>
1. Give optimized solution to complex problems
2. organized code in proper format.
3.DSA is foundation for almost every software like GPS, Search Engines, AI ChatBots, Gaming Apps, Databases, Web Applications, etc.
